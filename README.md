Before we start coding, let's understand exactly what sentiment analysis is. According to definition:

**Sentiment analysis** is a type of data mining that measures the inclination of peopleâ€™s opinions through natural language processing (NLP), computational linguistics and text analysis, which are used to extract and analyze subjective information from the Web - mostly social media and similar sources.
